#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# BASH LOGIN
#
# Executes commands at login (after .bashrc).
#
# Typically, most users will encounter a login shell only if either:
#   * they logged in from a tty, not through a GUI
#   * they logged in remotely, such as through ssh.
#
# If the shell was started any other way, such as through GNOME’s gnome-terminal
# or KDE’s konsole, then it is typically not a login shell — the login shell was
# what started GNOME or KDE behind your back when you logged in; things started anew
# are not login shells. New terminals or new screen windows you open are not login
# shells either.
# (Starting a new window in macOS’s Terminal.app seems to count as a login shell, though.)
#
# Put `~/.bash_login` stuff in the Conditional Configuration section of `~/.bashrc`.
#
# See comments in `~/.bashrc` for detailed summary.
